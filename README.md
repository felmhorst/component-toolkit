# Component Toolkit

Although HTML already provides a large variety of input components, some of them are very inconsistent across different
browsers and operating systems and provide only limited customization. Building your own components can be difficult,
especially when considering accessibility needs, internationalization, and required keyboard and touch controls.

To improve my skills and save some time when developing my next app, I decided to create a toolkit of commonly used,
reusable, accessible, and entirely customizable components.

This is just a passion project  If you're looking for a reliable package of input components I recommend
